# Furniture exchange x Supabase ‚ö°Ô∏è
We couldn't decide on a name. We ran out of time üòÜ

## Live demo
[furniture-exchange.vercel.app](https://furniture-exchange.vercel.app)

## The idea
Like our very creative name suggests, it is a furniture swap site for people moving cities. Let us explain. 

Suppose you are moving cities and you've got a shitload of furniture. Let's be real, no one wants to move furniture or, worse yet, sell & buy new furniture after moving. It's a hassle. So why not just...trade it?

For example if you are moving from LA to SF, you can a) Post a listing on the app saying that you are willing to trade furniture, or b) Search for existing listings on the app matching your needs (i.e. a person moving from SF to LA). It's that simple.

## Tech
We ‚ù§Ô∏è Supabase. We used Supabase (ofc), Supabase UI, Supabase Auth & Supabase Storage ‚Äî proper SupaStack!
